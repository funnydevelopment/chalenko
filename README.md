# Test assignment for a vacancy Middle-Level Python Developer (Cryptocurrency Trading Bot)
## Interview Task: 
Create a Candlestick Chart and Calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
## Objective
Your task is to create a public project on GitHub or GitLab and write a program to perform the following operations:
1. Retrieve Trades: Read the trades from the provided CSV file. https://perp-analysis.s3.amazonaws.com/interview/prices.csv.zip
2. Form Candlesticks: Based on the given time period, aggregate the trades into candlesticks (OHLC format).
3. Calculate EMA: Implement a function to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for the given length.
## Requirements
1. Language: Python.
2. Repository: Create a public repository on GitHub or GitLab and upload all the necessary files.
3. ead Trades: Your program must be able to read trades from a provided CSV file. The file will contain the following columns: Timestamp, Price.
4. Candlestick Formation: Aggregate trades into candlesticks based on the provided time interval (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour). The candlesticks should include Open, High, Low, Close values.
